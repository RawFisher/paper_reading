* Introduction
** Brief Info
- *Title*: Detecting Human-Object Interaction via Fabricated Compositional Learning
- *First author*: Zhi Hou
- *Institutes*: The University of Sydney
- *Conference*: CVPR 2021
- *PDF*: [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08214.pdf]]
- *Code*: [[https://github.com/zhihou7/FCL]]

** Problem
*** Generalized Zero-Shot HOI Detection
    - Problem of *imbalanced learning* and *zero-shot learning*.
    - Evaluated on both seen and unseen classes.
    - Existing works do not foucus on generalized zero-shot HOI detection.

** Contribution
- Generating *fake* samples for rare and unseen HOI categories on feature perspetive.
- Designing an object fabricator to generate objects for HOI composition.

* Method
** Fabricated Compositional Learning
*** Idea
    - Extracting a HOI instance feature to (o, v).
    - Using a generator generates other object feature $o^{'}$ and be combined with verb feature v to ($o^{'}$, v).

** Framework
*** Multitask Learning
    - Spatial HOI branch, HOI branch, fabricated compositinal branch

[[./pic/framework_overview.png]]

** Spatial HOI Branch
- Spatial feature: concatenation of human and object masks, i.e., the value in the human/object bounding box region is 1 and 0 elsewhere.
- Concatenating spatial and human features to classify HOI.

** HOI Branch
- Concatenating object and verb features to classify HOI (classifior different from spatial branch).
- Verb feature is extracted from union of object and human boxes.
- Regularizing verb feature.

** Fabricated Compositional Branch
- Generating fake object features for composing new HOIs.
- Concatenating verb and fake object features to classify HOI (classifior same as HOI branch).

** Fabricated Compositional Branch
- Fabricator: $o^{'}=MLP(concat(obj\_emb_{j}, noise, verb)), 0<=j<N_{o}$, $N_{o}$ is the number of all different objects.
- $noise \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$
- Three kind of object identity: object variable (trainable), word embedding, one-hot.

** Training
- Loss: $\mathcal L=\lambda_1\mathcal L_{hoi}+\lambda_2\mathcal L_{CL}+\lambda_3\mathcal L_{reg}+\mathcal L_{hoi\_sp}$
- Binary cross entropy losses.
- Verb feature contains the pose information of the object, making it difficult to jointly train with object fabricator.

*** Step-Wise training strategy
    1. Pre-training the network without the fabricator branch. ($\mathcal L_{hoi}$, $\mathcal L_{reg}$, $\mathcal L_{hoi\_sp}$)
    2. Fixing pre-trained model and train the randomly initialized object fabricator. ($\mathcal L_{CL}$)
    3. Jointly fine-tune all branches. ($\mathcal L$)

** Inference
- $S^c_{h,o}=s_h \cdot s_o \cdot S^c_{sp} \cdot S^c_{hoi}$

* Experience
** Zero-Shot HOI Detection
- *HICO-DET unseen composition*. The training data contains all factors (verbs and objects) but misses the verb-object pairs.
  - *Rare-first selection*. Selecting 120 unseen HOIs from rare preferentially.
  - *Non-rare first selection*. Selecting 120 unseen HOIs from non-rare preferentially.
  - Unseen(120 HOIs), Seen(480 HOIs), Full(600 HOIs).
- *HICO-DET unseen object*. Objects in testing data do not appear in the training data.
  - 12 objects from 80 objects and picking all HOIs containing these objects as unseen HOIs.
  - Unseen(100 HOIs), Seen(500 HOIs), Full(600 HOIs).

** Zero-Shot HOI Detection
- Baseline method is the model without fabricated compositional branch.
- Factorized model: replacing the HOI branch with verb and object stream.

** Ablation Studies
*** Setting
    - Selecting 120 unseen HOIs in rare and non-rare categories.
    - 24 rare categories and 96 non-rare categories.
*** Fabricated Compositional Learning
    - With fabricator can steadily improve the performance.
    - Orthogonal to verb feature regularization.
[[./pic/fabricator_verb_ablation.png]]

** Ablation Studies
*** Fabricator
    - Verb regularization can slightly improve the rare and unseen performance. (row 1,3)
    - Performance drops without verb or noise.
    - Adding verb fabricator (verb identity, object feat and noise) is even worse.
    - Difficult to directly generate useful verb due to complexity and abstraction.

** Ablation Studies
*** Step-Wise and One-Step
    - Step-wise has *better* performance in *rare* and *non-rare* categories.
    - Step-wise has *worse* performance in *unseen* categories.
    - Step-wise has *bias* to seen categories in the first step.
[[./pic/step-wise-one-step.png]]

** Ablation Studies
*** Quality of Detected Objects
    - Two-stage methods suffer from massive negative proposals produced from the first stage.
    - If detected boxes are false, cause that fabricated objects are less useful.

* Conclusion
** Conclusion
- Design Fabricated Compostional Learning approach to compose samples for open long-tailed HOI Detection.
- Design an object fabricator to fabricate object features.
- Stitch the fake object features and real verb features to compose HOI samples.

** Discussion
- More semantic prior? (verbs, objects, HOIs)
- ...
